# Yup this is Coho's page, you found it.

A little about me:
* Grew up on a farm in the midwest
* Been in game development since 2008
* Really into getting better CI/CD, VCS, and workflow solutions for game development (particularly for distributed teams)
* Really into Earthbound, MonsterHunter, Eve Online, and Factorio
